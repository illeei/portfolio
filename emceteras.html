          <h2>Case study coming soon.</h2>
          <p>Emceteras is an e-commerce site that sells minimalist prints and posters.</p>
          <!-- <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>In the recent years, Food Trucks had become increasingly popular especially in urban cities. According to a recent article published by City Lab, the U.S. food truck industry blew past the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time on 2012. This makes it one of the fastest-growing sectors of the national food and restaurant market. On the business side of things, numerous studies have been conducted about how digital technology is tied with how succesful a food truck is. Truck locations vary every day and owners and consumers depend on social media to announce where the current location is. </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>There are two main problems that Bite Site addresses. First, because food trucks mainly rely on Twitter and other social sites to let consumers know of their location, they first need to establish their presence and build up their following to ensure people even know to look for them. This is a primary challenge for new food trucks.  The second problem Bite Site eliminates is the time people spend waiting in lines. Most food trucks' target audience are largely office employees who often have between 30 minutes to an hour to spend for lunch.</p>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Bite Site uses geo-location services to locate food trucks in your area and lets you place an order in advance. Consumers are able to see all the food trucks in the area, increasing the chances of a new food truck to be "discovered" while the ability to place your order in advance on ensures that users are able to plan their meal breaks better. Consumers are also able to read and leave reviews to help others with their meal choices.</p> -->
