          <h4>Where I was...</h4>
          <div class="content-text">
            <p>Over 10 years ago, I was at a crossroads - do I major in Education or Computer Science? I excelled in all my Computer subjects all through high school. I picked up concepts relatively quick and the ability to solve challenges was exhilarating. The field appealed to me but man, I loved being around children.</p>
            <p>And so I picked Early Childhood Education. I love teaching. The challenge of simplifying the world so that little children can understand their environment came naturally to me. In seeing my students thrive, I felt accomplished. I built a career in being an educator but I knew there was something missing.</p>
            </div>
          <h4>How I got here...</h4>
          <div class="content-text">
            <p>After 7 years of teaching, I decided it was time for a change. I tried different things after - I did photography and graphic design, social media marketing, makeup artistry, and even had a stint managing a cosmetics counter in the retail world.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until earlier in 2017 that I learned about UI &amp; UX design. I got really curious and read up about it. I connected with designers and asked them about their experiences. I looked into courses and that’s how I found out about Bloc’s <a href="www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Designer Track</a>. Wait, I get to do market research, talk to people, design pretty things and code at the same time?   <p><strong>WHAT?? SIGN ME UP!</strong></p> <p>Later on in the same year, I got awarded a scholarship to Udacity's Front-End Development Course through the Grow With Google Program.</p>

          <h4>Where I'm headed...</h4>
          <div class="content-text">
              <p>Armed with a positive spirit, the love of solving puzzles, and the constant desire for learning, my journey began.</p><p>I am determined to understand users and make their experiences better by helping make the web usable and pretty. I want to code things and build things. I want to see my creations out in the world, making people's lives easier.</p>
              <p>Today, when I’m not immersed in all things design  &amp; development, I’m a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/illee.artistry" target="_blank">Freelance Makeup Artist</a> and strive to help my clients feel good by looking their best. I enjoy watching Netflix, snowboarding, trying out different restaurants, watching football and hiking. I also really like taking naps.</p>
